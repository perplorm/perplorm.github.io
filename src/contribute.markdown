# Contributing to Perpl is easy!

You are welcome to join us at maintaining Perpl, the still maintained and much improved fork of Propel2.

## Comments, complaints, corrections

Submit issues, file bug reports, request features, open pull requests or just join the discussions at the Perplorm repositories on  GitHub: 

* [Perpl](https://github.com/perplorm/perpl) : Perpl ORM.
* [perplorm.github.com](https://github.com/perplorm/perplorm.github.com) : the Perpl documentation (this website).

## Help fix the documentation

We host this fork of the Propel documentation, and there is so much to fix. Help us to separate tutorial and documentation, and to cleanup the writing. It is easy to participate, [here is how.](/contribute-documentation.html)

## Improve Perpl

Add new functionality, fix bugs, streamline workflows, or modernize legacy code - Perpl offers a welcoming environment to programmers who want to gain experience in contributing to Open Source Software, or who simply enjoy participating. It works through a common process outlined [here](/contribute-perpl.html)
