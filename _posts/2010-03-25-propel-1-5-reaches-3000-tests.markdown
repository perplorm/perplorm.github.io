title: Propel 1.5 reaches 3000 tests
published: true

With <a href="http://propel.phpdb.org/trac/changeset/1639">revision 1639</a>, Propel 1.5 has reached the 3000th unit test in the test suite. That's more than three times the number of unit tests in Propel 1.4 (928), and six times the number of unit tests in Propel 1.3.

Propel 1.5 is going to be the most robust Propel release ever. Even though we added a lot of features, we're very confident that Propel will run smoothly in your applications, thanks to the quality insurance provided by unit tests and test-driven development.
